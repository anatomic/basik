Together, we identify promising students from disadvantaged families who are at risk of dropping out due to financial hardship.\n\nYour donations fund education sponsorships at three levels: vocational training, secondary school, and university. Each sponsor receives photos of their student and an annual report detailing their progress.\n\nWant to get involved?

        "description": "BASIK began life in 2006 when we started raising money to fund the rebuilding of Kilimani Primary School.\n\nThe school was a mud hut in a rural location outside Mombasa, with two teachers supporting 70 students. It had no basic facilities and materials. We worked with Head Teacher Julius Nzai to rebuild the school and support children who couldn't afford to pay their fees to get an education.\n\nKilimani now has brick built classrooms for all year groups, a staff room, toilets, clean running water and more teachers to provide a better quality education. The school now supports over 150 students from the local community! This was our first project as a charity and we're very proud of what we helped to achieve at Kilimani and the opportunities the students will gain from an education.",
