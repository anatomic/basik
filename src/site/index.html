            <div class="w-2/3">
                <p>We are working to <strong>end poverty through education</strong> and give children the opportunity to
                    have a
                    brighter future. BASIK provides schools with running water, desks, toilets and a building that will
                    last. We
                    also ensure that children who cannot afford to go to school can go and <strong>give all pupils a malaria
                        net</strong> to take
                    home.</p>

                <p>With your help we can bring <strong>lasting change to children's lives</strong> by giving them an education.</p>

            <p>We are now working in partnership with Simon Musila and the Tsavo East Community Development Initiative.
                TECDI are a community organisation in Kenya that like us are hoping to educate children as a long-term
                solution to fight poverty. Simon runs the initiative in his spare time to try and help his community.
                They have started a community library and museum as well as coming together to support children with
                their school fees. They do this around the Tsavo East National Park in the Kasaala disctrict.</p>
            <p>If you would like to find out more or get involved with the charity, please email Chris or Celia.</p>

            <p>BASIK began life in 2006 when we started raising money to fund the rebuilding of Kilimani Primary
                School.</p>

            <p>The school was a mud hut in a rural location outside Mombasa, with two teachers supporting 70 students.
                It had no basic facilities and materials. We worked with Head Teacher Julius Nzai to rebuild the school
                and support children who couldn't afford to pay their fees to get an education.</p>

            <p>Kilimani now has brick built classrooms for all year groups, a staff room, toilets, clean running water
                and more teachers to provide a better quality education. The school now supports over 150 students from
                the local community! This was our first project as a charity and we're very proud of what we helped to
                achieve at Kilimani and the opportunities the students will gain from an education.</p>
