            <p>We are working to <strong>end poverty through education</strong> and give children the opportunity to
                have a brighter future. BASIK provides schools with running water, desks, toilets and a building
                that will last. We also ensure that children who cannot afford to go to school can go and <strong>give
                    all
                    pupils a malaria net</strong> to take home.</p>

            <p>With your help we can bring <strong>lasting change to children's lives</strong> by giving them an
                education.</p>

                <p>We are now working in partnership with Simon Musila and the Tsavo East Community Development
                    Initiative.
                    TECDI are a community organisation in Kenya that like us are hoping to educate children as a
                    long-term
                    solution to fight poverty. Simon runs the initiative in his spare time to try and help his
                    community.
                    They have started a community library and museum as well as coming together to support children with
                    their school fees. They do this around the Tsavo East National Park in the Kasaala disctrict.</p>
                <p>If you would like to find out more or get involved with the charity, please email Chris or Celia.</p>

                <p>BASIK began life in 2006 when we started raising money to fund the rebuilding of Kilimani Primary
                    School.</p>

                <p>The school was a mud hut in a rural location outside Mombasa, with two teachers supporting 70
                    students.
                    It had no basic facilities and materials. We worked with Head Teacher Julius Nzai to rebuild the
                    school
                    and support children who couldn't afford to pay their fees to get an education.</p>

                <p>Kilimani now has brick built classrooms for all year groups, a staff room, toilets, clean running
                    water
                    and more teachers to provide a better quality education. The school now supports over 150 students
                    from
                    the local community! This was our first project as a charity and we're very proud of what we helped
                    to
                    achieve at Kilimani and the opportunities the students will gain from an education.</p>

                    We split our funds between building new facilities, supplying

                <p>
                    A regular donation of &pound;10 a month will cover the costs of sending
                    one child to secondary school for a year. &pound;50 a month would help
                    us fund a student through a year at university. No matter what you
                    can afford, a regular donation is the best way to support BASIK.
