Hi everyone,

We just received the latest annual report from our partners at the Tsavo East Community Development Initiative (TECDI), covering July 2024 to July 2025. Reading through it reminds us exactly why we do what we do. It’s not just about statistics; it’s about real young people in Kasaala getting a shot at a future they deserve.
We wanted to share the highlights with you because this is your success as much as it is theirs.

## The Headlines 

This has been a massive year for student intake. TECDI was able to take on 12 new beneficiaries this year, and we're incredibly proud to tell you that BASIK is sponsoring ten of these new students.

These aren't just numbers on a page. These are young people heading off to universities and colleges to study subjects that will change their communities. We are supporting new students in degrees like Mathematics, Business Information Technology, and Economics & Statistics, as well as diplomas in Nursing and Teacher Education.

## Where your money actually goes

One of the things we love most about working with TECDI is how efficient they are. The report breaks down the finances clearly: 97% of the project funding went directly to the students.

That money pays for school fees (which is the bulk of it), but also the essentials that keep a student going - food, rent, and uniforms. Only 3% was spent on administration. It’s rare to find that kind of direct impact, and it means your donations are working hard on the ground.

### Breaking the cycle: Wambua’s story

The report included some alumni testimonies that really bring home the long-term value of this work. One that stood out is Wambua Philip, who was supported by BASIK.

When Wambua was in secondary school, his father fell seriously ill, and the family’s income had to go toward medical bills. Wambua was ready to drop out and had lost hope. But the scholarship stepped in. He finished high school, went on to get a Bachelor of Commerce from Kenyatta University, and is now working as a cashier at a bank in Kitui County.

The best part? He says, "The income I have earned from my current job has enabled me to sustain myself, my parents and pay school fees for siblings". That is exactly what we want to see - one sponsorship helping an entire family stand on its own feet.

## Tools for the job

We know that tuition fees aren't always enough. When students graduate, they need the right equipment to join the workforce. This year, the BASIK project funded the purchase of laptops for two of our alumni, Kyalo Mbindu and Bernard Michael Mwambu, to help them transition into their careers. It’s a practical step that makes a huge difference.

## The Road to 2040

We have a big shared vision with TECDI: we want to educate 100 university graduates from the Kasaala location by the year 2040.

We are making great progress, but we have a long way to go. If you are already supporting us, thank you - you are changing lives. If you’ve been thinking about donating, now is a great time to get involved. As the report says, we are planting seeds that will grow for generations!

As always, thank you for your continued support!\
The BASIK Team
