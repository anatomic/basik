    <h1>Bringing lasting change to children's lives through education</h1>
    <p>
      We are working to <strong>end poverty through education</strong> and give
      children the opportunity to have a brighter future. BASIK provides schools
      with running water, desks, toilets and a building that will last. We also
      ensure that children who cannot afford to go to school can go and give{" "}
      <strong>all pupils a malaria net</strong> to take home.
    </p>
    <p>
      With your help we can bring lasting change to children's lives by giving
      them an education.
